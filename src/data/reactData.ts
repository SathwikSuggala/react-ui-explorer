      "description": "**React** is a popular **JavaScript library** primarily used for building dynamic and interactive **user interfaces (UIs)** for web applications. Think of it as a toolkit for creating reusable UI pieces called **components**. Instead of updating the entire webpage, React cleverly updates only the parts that change, making apps feel much faster and smoother. This is achieved through its **virtual DOM**. It's declarative, meaning you describe *what* the UI should look like for a given state, and React handles the *how*. It's widely used for **single-page applications** and is backed by Facebook, ensuring strong community support and continuous development."

    "frequentlyAskedQuestions": {
      "description": [
        {
          "question": "Is React a framework or a library?",
          "answer": "React is officially described as a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While it can form the core of a framework (like Next.js), React itself focuses primarily on the view layer."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between state and props?",
          "answer": "Props (properties) are passed *into* a component from its parent (read-only), while state is managed *within* the component itself and can change over time, causing re-renders."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is JSX?",
          "answer": "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. React uses it to describe what the UI should look like. Browsers don't understand JSX directly; it needs to be compiled (usually by Babel) into regular JavaScript."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to learn Redux to use React?",
          "answer": "No. Redux is a separate state management library. For simpler applications, React's built-in state (`useState`) and Context API are often sufficient. Learn Redux (or alternatives like Zustand) when managing complex, application-wide state becomes difficult."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are React Hooks?",
          "answer": "Hooks are functions (like `useState`, `useEffect`) that let you 'hook into' React state and lifecycle features from functional components. They allow you to write stateful logic without using class components."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is React difficult to learn?",
          "answer": "React has a manageable learning curve, especially if you have a strong JavaScript foundation. Understanding concepts like components, state, props, and JSX is key. The ecosystem can seem vast, but focus on the core first."
